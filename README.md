UNIX tools write in Rust lang

**Credits to this repo's starter code, ideas and designs are mostly from doc.rust-lang.org
(the Rust book) and Standford Univerisity CS110L (Safety in Systems Programming)**

According the reference above, I derive my own version of tools, the target is
to implement memory efficient, robust and safe system tools and learn the
safety programming semantics from the design of language Rust. :)
